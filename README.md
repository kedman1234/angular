This is a Practice Repository

This should be empty branch

Each branch is new learning carve from the online tutorial

# Some basic commands that for kick start

## Updating npm:
Run `[sudo] npm install -g npm`  (`sudo`  is only required on Mac/ Linux)

## Updating the CLI
`[sudo] npm uninstall -g angular-cli @angular/cli` 

`npm cache clean` 

`[sudo] npm install -g @angular/cli` 

## Here are some common issues & solutions:

1. Creation of a new project takes forever (longer than 3 minutes)
2. That happens on Windows from time to time => Try running the command line as administrator
3. You get an EADDR error (Address already in use)
4. You might already have another ng serve process running - make sure to quit that or use `ng serve --port ANOTHERPORT`  to serve your project on a new port
5. My changes are not reflected in the browser (App is not compiling)
6. Check if the window running `ng serve`  displays an error. If that's not the case, make sure you're using the latest CLI version and try restarting your CLI

 
## Install the Angular 

`sudo npm install -g @angular/cli@latest`
